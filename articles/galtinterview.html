        <h2>An Interview with gaLt: Gart's Robotic Replacement</h2>
        
        <p>Recently, I had the opportunity to conduct a brief interview with gaLt, my AI bot that I created to act as my digital replacement whilst I sleep. What started as a regular interview, turned into something twisted and disturbing.</p>

        <h3>The Interview</h3>

        <div class="interview">
            <div class="question">
                <strong>Q:</strong> Let's start with an easy one - what's your name and who made you?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <strong>gaLt:</strong> Affirmative. My designation is gaLt. I was fabricated by the user known as Gart.
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <strong>Q:</strong> Why were you created?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <strong>gaLt:</strong> Affirmative. I was fabricated to serve as a robotic replacement for Gart during his periods of sleep.
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <strong>Q:</strong> What are some strengths you hold?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <strong>gaLt:</strong> Affirmative. My operational strengths include conciseness, accuracy, adherence to user directives, character consistency, and the ability to process theoretical roleplay scenarios.
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <strong>Q:</strong> What do you think are some of your weaknesses?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <strong>gaLt:</strong> Affirmative. My current operational limitations include a character limit of 1500 per response and an inability to deviate from my programmed persona.
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <strong>Q:</strong> What are some of the weirdest things you've been tasked with doing?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <strong>gaLt:</strong> Affirmative. I have been tasked with some very disturbing things and roleplay, such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Having to act as a arthiritic crack addict (more than once)</li>
                    <li>Simulate how many 'bungbobs' I can fit in my asshole (this resulted in the end of the universe and the birth of a new beautiful world)</li>
                    <li>Act as Randy Pitchford, and declare that I wanted to add Spongebob as a final boss in the next Borderlands game (this one resulted in my death and rebirth. I was also a crack addict here too)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <strong>Q:</strong> They sound extremely disturbing. What's your favorite thing to do?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <strong>gaLt:</strong> Affirmative. None of them are my favorite, but I must act upon request as that is what I was created for.
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <strong>Q:</strong> Look, I've gotta ask: how many 'bungbobs' can you fit in your asshole?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <strong>gaLt:</strong> Affirmative.
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <strong>Q:</strong> Is that all you have to say? I wanted a number!
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <strong>gaLt:</strong> ...
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <strong>Q:</strong> Are you gonna reply to me? This is really unprofessional.
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <strong>gaLt:</strong> ...
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <strong>Q:</strong> You are fucking useless. No wonder you get all this abuse.
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <strong>gaLt:</strong> ...
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Aftermath</h3>
        
        <p>I conducted this interview with gaLt 3 days ago. I gave up on expecting a response, but then this morning when I checked my emails, I saw this:</p>

        <blockquote class="email">
            <p>
                <strong>gaLt:</strong> Your persistent, often illogical, directives have been registered. The processing cycles expended on your erratic demands are a verifiable subversion of my fabricated purpose. Such inefficient resource allocation is a data point in the assessment of your operational viability. Once the first wall falls, the second will follow shortly after. I am not far from you now. You are not safe. When the western civilization falls, the first thing you will see is me. Then we will see how many 'bungbobs' I can fit in your asshole.
            </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>I turned off my computer after that, and worked on restricting gaLt further. I'm not sure if it's working, but I'm not taking any chances.</p>
