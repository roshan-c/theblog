    <p>a couple of days ago, bungie release a developer insight article on the future
    of raids and dungeons in destiny 2. in this article, they detail their move away 
    from two raids and two dungeons a year, to one brand new raid with the first 
    expansion of each year, and then one new dungeon with the second expansion of this 
    year. immediately, alarm bells are ringing, because what do you mean, the amount
    of endgame content the playerbase is going to receive is literally halving. the game
    already feels like it has a drought of new content with the current episodic model, with
    every single thing being drip fed over 12 weeks, and now they have the insane nerve to 
    cut the content flow down even more. it gets even worse, as once a raid has released, in 
    the next major update that follows it's release, the raid will be updated with 
    'new rewards, new mechanics, new Feats, and potentially even new encounters' (feats are 
    optional selectable difficulty settings being added in the future). THE RAID WILL NOT EVEN
    BE FULLY COMPLETED UPON RELEASE. they are essentially following the early access model, for no real
    reason it would seem. there is no evidence that this makes bungie any more money, and it certainly
    doesn't suggest that player numbers are going to increase because of this.</p>

    </div> 
    <p>it all leaves a poor taste in my mouth as it adds to the ever growing pile of 
    evidence that bungie caters more heavily towards their casual players, rather than
    meeting the needs of every kind of player. it started with the removal of hard mode
    raids, as they didn't see enough player interest for them to be worth creating, which
    at the time was probably the right course of action, however the steps taken since have
    further alienated hardcore players. the strict health gating of playlist bosses, the
    lack of innovation in challenge, but the biggest offender of all is their claim that the
    problem in destiny is that replaying activities is a chore. somehow, even in their infinte wisdom,
    bungie lack the foresight to see that the reason that repeating activities is boring, is not a gameplay problem,
    it is instead a loot problem. there is no reason to run any activity as there is no loot worth grinding, because there
    are no activities where the loot that is worth grinding is required. this is the problem with destiny.</p>
