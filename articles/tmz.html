    <h2>TMZ: GART FOUND DEAD AT 20</h2>
    <p class="date">october 20th 2024</p>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="" id="gart-dead-img" alt="gart found dead at 20" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
    <figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">gart found dead at 20</figcaption>
    </div>
    <script>
      document.getElementById('gart-dead-img').src = '../' + getImagePath('gart-dead');
    </script>
    <p>many speculate that gart took his own life after the immense pressure for his latest release (gartpack : the master scrap collection) collapsed on himself after launch. critics cited it's poor performance, and a number of 'red-flags' in it's content, as reasons that it flopped</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="" id="overdeliver-img" alt="overdeliver" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
    <figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">gart's last words</figcaption>
    </div>
    <script>
      document.getElementById('overdeliver-img').src = '../' + getImagePath('overdeliver');
    </script>
    <p>gart's last words were "i just wanted to overdeliver", and it is clear that he was trying his best. our thoughts are with his family and friends at this time</p>
