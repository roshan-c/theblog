    <p>hello, my name is roshan 👋, but usually found online under the alias
    of gart 🎭🎭, and this is my blog 📑. this introductory post will always
    be at the top 🔝, however, future posts will feature in reverse
    chronological order 🔁so that the newest is always at the top. i have
    recently started an undergraduate degree in computer science 🤓💻, and
    have studied it since gcse level. for the last ten years 😖, i have been
    playing destiny 🤢, and i have found it impossible to stay normal about
    it, and i have an increasingly difficult time not sharing elitist takes
    about it ✅✅.</p>
