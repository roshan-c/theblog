    <h1 id="2025-the-year-of-the-gart-cup">üèÜ 2025 - the year of the gart cup</h1>
    <p><strong>january 9th 2025</strong></p>
    <p>i know, i know. the moment you've all been waiting for, is finally here. real gartcup
      information!!! after a quick poll for the community summit, the games have been decided,
      as well as the introduction of a new award. the games are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lethal Company</li>
        <li>Black Ops 3 Zombies</li>
        <li>Halo MCC</li>
        <li>Left 4 Dead 2</li>
        <li>Doors</li>
        <li>Destiny 2</li>
        <li>League of Legends</li>
        <li>Deep Rock Galactic</li>
        <li>Call of Duty: Ghosts - Extinction</li>
        <li>Counter-Strike 2</li>
        <li>Phasmophobia</li>
      </ul>
      <p>and announcing the new award: the virgin of the year! this award is completely 
        community nominated, and will be awarded to the person who is the biggest virgin.
        the winner will be revealed during the quiz.</p>
      <p>the format of the cup has been altered (AGAIN). previously, you could choose between two games
        in a single bracket and complete the challenged associated; however, i feel that this creates
        an unfair advantage, as the games are not equal in terms of difficulty, and there may be
        some players that are extremely experienced in one game, and not the others.
