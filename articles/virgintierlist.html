    <h2>the virgin tierlist</h2>
    <p class="date">october 12th 2024</p>
    <p>this is the virgin tierlist. as you can see, i have created five seperate tiers, these being: mega mega virgin, regular
        virgin, some touching, has had sexual encounters, or has had sex.
    </p>            
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img id="myImg" src="../images/tierlist/tierlist2x.png" alt="the virgin tierlist" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">click on this image!</figcaption>
        <div id="myModal" class="modal">
            <span class="close">&times;</span>
            <img class="modal-content" id="img01">
            <div id="caption">this is the virgin tierlist</div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>the reason why i have created this tierlist is because i have been thinking about the concept of virginity a lot recently. i have been thinking about how it is a social construct, and how it is a 
        concept that is used to shame people. i have been thinking about how it is a concept that is used to control people and that they are not good enough. well, look, i'm here to say that you should feel that way as a virgin.
    </p>

        <img src="../images/tierlist/thereason.png" alt="the reason the tierlist exists" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">the reason the tierlist exists</figcaption>
    </div>
    <h3>now, to explain my reasoning behind the placement on tiers.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>savir savir sohal singh is in the "mega mega virgin" tier because of his immense addiction to gatcha titles, his religion-esque devotion to miHoYo, and the hentai addiction</li>
        <li>dre and prz find themselves in the "regular virgin" tier as i just think that's what they are, nothing against them, i think together they'd make a lovely couple</li>
        <li>harrison and theoden lysander are in the "some touching" tier, im not 100% clear on either of their statuses though. i remember mention of a chinese girl that harrison was talking to, so i know he has some game, and the rumours surrounding theoden are not good (e-sex)</li>
        <li>liam finds himself in the "has had sexual encounters" tier literaly just because he is married, and he must have done something with this spouse at some point</li>
        <li>and finally, me and riley are within the "has had sex" tier, as we have both had sex. nothing more to explain</li>
    </ul>
