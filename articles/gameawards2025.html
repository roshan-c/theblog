        <p>welcome to my LIVE coverage of the game awards 2025! i consider it a real pleasure that geoff keighley would even think of inviting me to the event! i'm not sure how he knows who i am, how he got my number, or even how he found where i live, but never the less, i'm excited to see what he has in store for us this year! it's t-minus 14 minutes till the show begins; i will return shortly.</p>

        <p>alright! geoff just came upon stage and is now welcoming us to the game awards 2025! he seemed a bit... wired, but i'm sure it's just because he's excited to be here. he's now introducing the categories for the night: game of the year, best narrative, best game direction, best ongoing game, best community support, best indie, most anticipated game, content creator of the year.</p>

        <p>okay, and we're starting off with best ongoing game! geoff has introduced his good friend, genghis khan, to the stage to present the award! the nominees are destiny 2, genshin impact, final fantasy 14, and league of legends.</p>
        <p>wow! what a great lineup! genghis isn't so sure... he's ranting about how if genshin doesnt win, he's going to kill everyone in the audience. he's now going to read the winner... and the winner is... <strong>genshin impact</strong>!</p>
        <p> phew! that was close! i'm sure genshin deserves it, but i dont think anyone really cares about that just now. we're all just relieved that genghis didnt kill us all. where did geoff even find genghis?</p>

        <p>okay it was literally a trailer for "the last of us part 1: remastered: rebuilt (2025 edition)" and it wasnt even that good. i'm sure it's a great game, but i'm not sure if it's worth the hype. geoff sure is excited about it though. so excited that he has a visible stain in his crotch area. i really hope its sweat.</p>

        <p>we're running long folks! geoff is panicking. he just announced the winners for best game direction, best rpg, best action, and best family game all in one breath while a deafening palantir ad played on the big screen. i think 'super mario poop scoop 2' won something? or maybe not? who knows.</p>

        <p>best indie time. the developer of 'emotional pixelated sad dad simulator' has won! they're starting a heartfelt speech about selling their kidney to fund the game... AND THE MUSIC KICKS IN. it's hans zimmer! the orchestra is blasting at 120 decibels after exactly eight seconds. the developer is being physically dragged off stage by geoff. ruthless.</p>

        <p>the most prestigious award of the night: content creator of the year. nominees: ishowspeed, kai cenat, a vtuber i've never seen before, and... geoff's dad? and the winner is... <strong>geoff's dad</strong>! he's on screen now yelling 'SHAUN!'. oh no, it's not a creator award, it's a heavy rain remaster ad. we've been duped.</p>

        <p>this is it. the big one. christopher nolan is on stage to present it. he's mumbling something about time being a flat circle. the nominees are: gta 6, death stranding 2, metroid prime 4, and 'generic sad dad simulator 5'. and the game of the year is... <strong>GTA 6</strong>! rockstar isn't even here to accept it. geoff is accepting it on their behalf. he's crying again. he's hugging the trophy. the credits are rolling. gonzo from the muppets is waving goodbye. what a night.</p>
