PARODY IDEAS:

"World Premieres" & Trailers:
- The "Vibe" Trailer: A 3-minute CGI trailer for a new sci-fi shooter that shows zero gameplay, just a slow-motion shot of a helmet in the rain with a moody cover of a pop song (maybe "Walking on Sunshine" but sad).
- The Unnecessary Remake: The Last of Us Part 1: Remastered: Rebuilt (2025 Edition) — literally just the same game but with slightly more realistic sweat physics.
- The Gacha Interruption: An anime sword girl yells "COMMANDER!" for 45 seconds. It turns out to be a collaboration between Genshin Impact and TurboTax.
- Kojima's "Connected" Experience: Hideo Kojima comes on stage for 20 minutes to reveal a game where you play as a cloud. The trailer is just 10 minutes of silence. He calls it "Strand-type silence."
- The "AAAA" Game: Ubisoft announces a "Quadruple-A" pirate game that requires a subscription to open the main menu.

The Show Itself:
- The "Speedrun" Award: Geoff Keighley announces the winner for "Best Narrative," "Best RPG," and "Best Direction" all in one breath while a Mountain Dew ad plays at full volume over him.
- The Celebrity Cameo: Timothée Chalamet presents "Best Strategy Game." He clearly has never seen a video game and mispronounces "Civilization."
- Geoff's Best Friend: The camera cuts to a shot of The Muppets' Gonzo sitting in the front row next to Christopher Nolan for no explained reason.
- The "Please Wrap It Up" Music: An indie developer starts giving a heartfelt speech about their mortgage, but the "Get Off Stage" orchestral music swells to Hans Zimmer levels after exactly 8 seconds.
- The Hardware Reveal: Sony announces the PS5 Pro Max Ultra. It costs $1,200, has no disc drive, and is shaped like a perfect sphere so it rolls off your shelf.

Ads disguised as content:
- The Schick Hydrobot: The razor robot returns, but now he's a playable character in Mortal Kombat 1.
- DoorDash Integration: A QR code stays on screen for the entire show. If you scan it, Geoff Keighley personally delivers a burrito to your house (delivery fee: $70).
