            <p class="date">september 24th 2024</p>
            <p>hello, my name is roshan, but usually found online under the alias of gart, and this is my blog. this introductory post will always be at the top, however, future posts will feature in reverse chronological order so that the newest is always at the top. i have recently started an undergraduate degree in computer science, and have studied it since gcse level. for the last ten years, i have been playing destiny, and i have found it impossible to stay normal about it, and i have an increasingly difficult time not sharing elitist takes about it.</p>

            <h2>thanks to shadow of the erdtree, elden ring is my goty for 3 years in a row</h2>

            </div>
            <p>in 2022, elden ring released and won game of the year at <a href='https://x.com/PenisIncognito/status/1732956953976906012'>geoff keighley</a>'s game awards. shortly after i picked it up for the first time, and played it all the way through co-op (using the seamless co-op mod). since then i have been infatuated with the world miyazaki and george r. r. martin crafted, and the soulsborne gameplay is something i crave constantly. after that playthrough, i named it as my choice for goty 2023, even as early as january that year! fast forward to june 2024, from software finally released elden ring's only dlc: shadow of the erdtree. before the review formally begins, can i just say i did beat pre-nerf final boss, so yeah, i am that much of a gamer. that being said, the rest of the review will feature spoilers. originally, after defeating mohg, nothing would happen with the cocoon behind him, however, with the release of the dlc, this acts as your entrance to the shadow realm. this place is huge, especically under the consideration that it is optional dlc.</p>
