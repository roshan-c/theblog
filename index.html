            <p>Hello, my name is Roshan, but usually found online under the alias of Gart, and this is my blog. This introductory post will always be at the top, however, future posts will feature in reverse chronological order so that the newest is always at the top. I have recently started an undergraduate degree in Computer Science, and have studied it since GCSE level. For the last ten years, I have been playing Destiny, and I have found it impossible to stay normal about it, and I have an increasingly difficult time not sharing elitist takes about it.</p>
