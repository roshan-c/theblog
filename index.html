      <p>hello, my name is roshan üëã, but usually found online under the alias
      of gart üé≠üé≠, and this is my blog üìë. this introductory post will always
      be at the top üîù, however, future posts will feature in reverse
      chronological order üîÅso that the newest is always at the top. i have
      recently started an undergraduate degree in computer science ü§ìüíª, and
      have studied it since gcse level. for the last ten years üòñ, i have been
      playing destiny ü§¢, and i have found it impossible to stay normal about
      it, and i have an increasingly difficult time not sharing elitist takes
      about it ‚úÖ‚úÖ.</p>

    <h1 id="2025 - the year of the gart cup"> üèÜ 2025 - the year of the gart cup</h2>
    <p><strong>january 9th 2025</strong></p>
    <p>i know, i know. the moment you've all been waiting for, is finally here. real gartcup
      information!!! after a quick poll for the community summit, the games have been decided,
      as well as the introduction of a new award. the games are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lethal Company</li>
      <li>Black Ops 3 Zombies</li>
      <li>Halo MCC</li>
      <li>Left 4 Dead 2</li>
      <li>Doors</li>
      <li>Destiny 2</li>
      <li>League of Legends</li>
      <li>Deep Rock Galactic</li>
      <li>Call of Duty: Ghosts - Extinction</li>
      <li>Counter-Strike 2</li>
      <li>Phasmophobia</li>
    </ul>
    <p>and announcing the new award: the virgin of the year! this award is completely 
      community nominated, and will be awarded to the person who is the biggest virgin.
      the winner will be revealed during the quiz.</p>
    <p>the format of the cup has been altered (AGAIN). previously, you could choose between two games
      in a single bracket and complete the challenged associated; however, i feel that this creates
      an unfair advantage, as the games are not equal in terms of difficulty, and there may be
      some players that are extremely experienced in one game, and not the others.

      <h1 id="an-open-letter-to-tyson-green"> üì∞ an open letter to Tyson
      Green</h2>
      <p><strong>december 16th 2024</strong></p>
      <p>dear Tyson Green, i am writing to you today to express my concerns about the future you have planned for Destiny 2.
        you have only been leading the helm for a short while (i have to assume at least since The Final Shape launched),
        and yet, in this time, you have done nothing but dissapoint. every single turn you make is the wrong one; would it be
        so bad to listen to the sav-nav once in a while?</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="destiny/toppagereddit.png" alt="top page post in the subreddit" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">the top-page post in the destiny subreddit yesterday</figcaption>
    </div>
    <p>this year in Destiny should have been a victory lap, a way to very easily win back everyone that had left, and yet somehow
        you have managed to make it worse. player counts are at their lowest, and player morale decreases by the second. this game
        is not that difficult to direct. even i could do it! in fact, here is every step i would have taken this year to progress the 
        game forwards, and to cement Joe Blackburn's legacy.</p>
    </p>
    <h3>2024: the victory lap</h3>
    <p>to begin with, i would address the story post Final Shape. the current model of self contained stories is awful,
        and it makes no sense. we know that the villain of the season is either going to die or just dissappear anyway,
        so why not have taken this year to start subtly building up to the next big bad? the darkness is still somewhat outthere,
        and we know that there is someone bigger than The Witness (he says at some point during The Final Shape that he is 'the First Knife of the darkness'),
        so why not lead up to the next big release in Frontiers? instead of this cookie cutter bullshit we have now.</p>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="destiny/tonics.avif" alt="screenshot taken from of the tonics screen" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">screenshot taken of the tonics screen</figcaption>
    </div>

    <p> next, i would address the loot grind. weapon crafting is not the evil you perceive it to be Tyson. it is a way to
        keep players engaged, and to keep them playing. the current model of 'play the game for 12 weeks, then leave for 12 weeks'
        is not sustainable, especically since you have cut the amount of endgame content in half AND you have removed the ability
        to focus for red-border weapons (of the season that is currently active). to re-iterate for those that do not know, you cannot
        receive or focus red-border weapons from the season that is currently active, which means you cannot add the crafting pattern
        for the weapon to your collection. you must farm for the specific roll that you want, except the current method of farming is 
        the absolute worst it has ever been. you can use a 'tonic' to focus your weapon drops to a smaller pool, but it does not guarantee
        a drop to occur, nor does it allow you to focus for the weapon you want. the way forward that i see, is to take a page out of the 
        menagerie's book, and introduce pure weapon focusing, maybe not exactly as it was back then, but similar. oh and it also only
        works in seasonal activities. just make the focusing for strikes, gambit and crucible loot cheaper man. none of the loot in those activities
        is worth the cost. wake up.
    </p>
    <p> the idea is simple: 5 different slots in the 'chalice', each serving a different purpose and using a different (get ready for 
        the real kicker) and very EASILY FARMABLE currencies. the first slot is for the weapon archetype, the second slot is for the weapon slot,
        the third slot is for the specifc weapon. the fourth and fifth slots would be to enable double perks in the 3rd and 4th perk slots, but the materials
        required for these slots would be earned from endgame activities (dungeon/raid encounters, trials, GMs, etc.). and even more importantly,
        you can still earn red-borders towards patterns, to mitigate the grind. this not only encourages player agency, but it respects their time,
        something you have personally failed to do Tyson.</p>
    <p>another pain point is related to loot in dungeons and legacy raids. there needs to be a way to receive a guaranteed red-border weapon at the end of every
        dungeon and raid, and there also needs to be the same focusing chest that is at the end of raids in dungeons.
    </p>
    <p>finally, i would reintoduce hard mode raids, with cosmetic rewards as incentive. the idea that hard mode raids are not worth
        the development cost as the amount of players that complete them is not high enough to justify their existance, is an outdated 
        mindset. the pantheon event proves this. the pantheon event even proves that hard mode encounters can be created, as the team at Bungie
        has shown they are creative enough to change the encounters in meaningful ways! hard mode raids also incentivise players to chase 
        powerful loot with the best perk combos, as it is an environment where you must be at your absolute strongest to succeed, and the cosmetic
        reward incentive is a way to show off to everyone else. I MEAN COME ON, IT IS LITERALLY THAT EASY TYSON.
    </p>
    <p> Tyson, please, do not continue to cover your ears and eyes and wake up to reality. it's never to late to change, but if you don't do
        it now, you might not get another chance.
    </p>
    <p> from, gart</p>
