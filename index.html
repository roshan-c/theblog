    <p><strong>september 24th 2024</strong></p>
    <p>hello, my name is roshan 👋, but usually found online under the alias
    of gart 🎭🎭, and this is my blog 📑. this introductory post will always
    be at the top 🔝, however, future posts will feature in reverse
    chronological order 🔁so that the newest is always at the top. i have
    recently started an undergraduate degree in computer science 🤓💻, and
    have studied it since gcse level. for the last ten years 😖, i have been
    playing destiny 🤢, and i have found it impossible to stay normal about
    it, and i have an increasingly difficult time not sharing elitist takes
    about it ✅✅.</p>

    <p><strong>december 16th 2024</strong></p>
    <p>dear Tyson Green, i am writing to you today to express my concerns about the future you have planned for Destiny 2.
      you have only been leading the helm for a short while (i have to assume at least since The Final Shape launched),
      and yet, in this time, you have done nothing but dissapoint. every single turn you make is the wrong one; would it be
      so bad to listen to the sav-nav once in a while?</p>
