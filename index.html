            been playing destiny ü§¢, and i have found it impossible to stay normal about it, 
            and i have an increasingly difficult time not sharing elitist takes about it ‚úÖ‚úÖ.</p>

            <h2>life is strange 2: 6 years on from episode 1</h2>
            <p class="'date">september 29th 2024</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="lis2/titlescreen.jpg" alt="life is strange 2 title screen" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
            <figcaption style="text-align: left; font-style: italic;">life is strange 2's title screen</figcaption>
            </div>
            <p>the original life is strange is a game i wholeheartedly believe is perfect, and i never thought that they would be able to top it. it is a fairly
                controversial opinion, but, i believe that life is strange 2 is better than the original. the story of sean and daniel diaz is one that i felt a distinct
                connection to as i could see myself in sean, and i could see my younger brother in daniel. the game is a road trip story, and it is a coming of age story, 
                and it is <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8LTCLSv-pY&pp=ygUbam9zZWYgZmFyZXMgZnVjayB0aGUgb3NjYXJz'>a tale of two sons</a>.
            </p>
            <p>episode one launched on the 26th of september of 2018; i had recently turned 14, fortnite season 6 had just released, and the forsaken expansion for destiny 2 had released
                two weeks prior. quite a heavy month for games i guess, and even with <a href='https://imgur.com/a/GyTPhLb'>forsaken</a> being such a game-saving expansion, life is strange 2 was the stand out experience for me.
            </p>

            <figcaption style="text-align: left; font-style: italic;">the opening frame of episode 1</figcaption>
            </div>
            <p>the game opens with a cinematic of a police car patrolling round a neighborhood, with the date constantly pulsing in the bottom left. october 2016 is the particular part of all 
                the specific camera filter choices the developers made that attracts the players attention, but it is so very important to the entire narrative of the game. the whole story essentially
                takes place as a consequence of the us presidential election of 2016, and the game is a direct response to the political climate of the time, specifically the trump presidency.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>not long after this cinematic plays out, we are introduced to sean diaz, one half of our protagonists through this journey. we are also shown his best friend, lyla, who flames
                sean for having no game, struggling to text his crush jenn murphy. this is the first of many moments in the game that are so relatable to the player. he also hates parties, just like me :3
            </p>
            <p>every single detail about this game is pure beauty, and plays right into my fantasy of living in the pacific northwest. the golden sun in october, the light autumn breeze, the gorgeous
                soundtrack; oh god that soundtrack. those giant redwood trees, the vast open desert (<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQTp8Ozj1JQ'>spoilers</a> for episode 4), the small towns, 
                the big cities, the mountains, the rivers, the lakes, the ocean. it is all so perfect.

            <h2>thanks to shadow of the erdtree, elden ring is my goty for 3 years in a row</h2>
            <p class="date">sometime 2024</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="erdtree/final.jpg" alt="the end of elden ring: shadow of the erdtree" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
            </div>
            <p>in 2022, elden ring released and won game of the year 
            at <a href='https://x.com/PenisIncognito/status/1732956953976906012'>geoff 
            keighley</a>'s game awards. shortly after i picked it up for the first time, 
            and played it all the way through co-op (using the seamless co-op mod). since 
            then i have been infatuated with the world miyazaki and george r. r. martin 
            crafted, and the soulsborne gameplay is something i crave constantly. after that 
            playthrough, i named it as my choice for goty 2023, even as early as january that 
            year! fast forward to june 2024, from software finally released elden ring's only 
            dlc: shadow of the erdtree. before the review formally begins, can i just say i 
            did beat pre-nerf final boss, so yeah, i am that much of a gamer. that being said, 
            the rest of the review will feature spoilers. originally, after defeating mohg, 
            nothing would happen with the cocoon behind him, however, with the release of the 
            dlc, this acts as your entrance to the shadow realm. this place is huge, especically 
            under the consideration that it is optional dlc.

            <h2>the virgin tierlist</h2>
            <p class="date">october 12th 2024</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img id="myImg" src="tierlist/tierlist.png" alt="the virgin tierlist" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
                <figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">click on this image!</figcaption>
                <div id="myModal" class="modal">
                    <span class="close">&times;</span>
                    <img class="modal-content" id="img01">
                    <div id="caption">this is the virgin tierlist</div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>this is the virgin tierlist. as you can see, i have created five seperate tiers, these being: mega mega virgin, regular
                virgin, some touching, has had sexual encounters, or has had sex.
            </p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="tierlist/thereason.png" alt="the reason the tierlist exists" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
                <figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">the reason the tierlist exists</figcaption>
            </div>
            <p>the reason why i have created this tierlist is because i have been thinking about the concept of virginity a lot recently. i have been thinking about how it is a social construct, and how it is a 
                concept that is used to shame people. i have been thinking about how it is a concept that is used to control people and that they are not good enough. well, look, i'm here to say that you should feel that way as a virgin.
            </p>
            <h3>now, to explain my reasoning behind the placement on tiers.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>savir savir sohal singh is in the "mega mega virgin" tier because of his immense addiction to gatcha titles, his religion-esque devotion to miHoYo, and the hentai addiction</li>
                <li>dre and prz find themselves in the "regular virgin" tier as i just think that's what they are, nothing against them, i think together they'd make a lovely couple</li>
                <li>harrison and theoden lysander are in the "some touching" tier, im not 100% clear on either of their statuses though. i remember mention of a chinese girl that harrison was talking to, so i know he has some game, and the rumours surrounding theoden are not good (e-sex)</li>
                <li>liam finds himself in the "has had sexual encounters" tier literaly just because he is married, and he must have done something with this spouse at some point</li>
                <li>and finally, me and riley are within the "has had sex" tier, as we have both had sex. nothing more to explain</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>bungie's future for destiny 2 is tonedeaf and unsustainable</h2>
            <p class="date">september 28th 2024</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="destiny/pantheonriven.png" alt="my own screenshot taken from the riven encounter within the pantheon challenge" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
            <figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">this is how my screen looked during the riven encounter within the pantheon challenge</figcaption>
            </div>
            <p>a couple of days ago, bungie release a developer insight article on the future
            of raids and dungeons in destiny 2. in this article, they detail their move away 
            from two raids and two dungeons a year, to one brand new raid with the first 
            expansion of each year, and then one new dungeon with the second expansion of this 
            year. immediately, alarm bells are ringing, because what do you mean, the amount
            of endgame content the playerbase is going to receive is literally halving. the game
            already feels like it has a drought of new content with the current episodic model, with
            every single thing being drip fed over 12 weeks, and now they have the insane nerve to 
            cut the content flow down even more. it gets even worse, as once a raid has released, in 
            the next major update that follows it's release, the raid will be updated with 
            'new rewards, new mechanics, new Feats, and potentially even new encounters' (feats are 
            optional selectable difficulty settings being added in the future). THE RAID WILL NOT EVEN
            BE FULLY COMPLETED UPON RELEASE. they are essentially following the early access model, for no real
            reason it would seem. there is no evidence that this makes bungie any more money, and it certainly
            doesn't suggest that player numbers are going to increase because of this.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="destiny/afkwarning.png" alt="my own screenshot taken after receiving a ban warning " style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
            <figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">my ban warning after afk farming exotic class items</figcaption>
            </div> 
            <p>it all leaves a poor taste in my mouth as it adds to the ever growing pile of 
            evidence that bungie caters more heavily towards their casual players, rather than
            meeting the needs of every kind of player. it started with the removal of hard mode
            raids, as they didn't see enough player interest for them to be worth creating, which
            at the time was probably the right course of action, however the steps taken since have
            further alienated hardcore players. the strict health gating of playlist bosses, the
            lack of innovation in challenge, but the biggest offender of all is their claim that the
            problem in destiny is that replaying activities is a chore. somehow, even in their infinte wisdom,
            bungie lack the foresight to see that the reason that repeating activities is boring, is not a gameplay problem,
            it is instead a loot problem. there is no reason to run any activity as there is no loot worth grinding, because there
            are no activities where the loot that is worth grinding is required. this is the problem with destiny.</p>
