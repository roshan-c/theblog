        <p><strong>september 24th 2024</strong></p>
        <p>hello, my name is roshan 👋, but usually found online under the alias
            of gart 🎭🎭, and this is my blog 📑. this introductory post will always
            be at the top 🔝, however, future posts will feature in reverse
            chronological order 🔁so that the newest is always at the top. i have
            recently started an undergraduate degree in computer science 🤓💻, and
            have studied it since gcse level. for the last ten years 😖, i have been
            playing destiny 🤢, and i have found it impossible to stay normal about
            it, and i have an increasingly difficult time not sharing elitist takes
            about it ✅✅.</p>

        <h1 id="microtransactions">where do we go now?</h1>
        <p><strong>march 15th 2025</strong></p>
        <p>microtransactions have been a hot topic in the gaming industry for the past few years.
            with the rise of free-to-play games, developers have been looking for ways to monetize
            their games without charging a flat fee. this has led to the rise of microtransactions,
            which allow players to purchase in-game items with real money. while some players are
            happy to spend money on microtransactions, others are not so keen. so where do we go now?</p>

        <p><strong>december 16th 2024</strong></p>
        <p>dear Tyson Green, i am writing to you today to express my concerns about the future you have planned for
            Destiny 2.
            you have only been leading the helm for a short while (i have to assume at least since The Final Shape
            launched),
            and yet, in this time, you have done nothing but dissapoint. every single turn you make is the wrong one;
            would it be
            so bad to listen to the sav-nav once in a while?</p>
